# Brainfuck Compiler (BFC)
==============

BFC is a compiler for the brainfuck programming language.

This project is an experimental and it was created for consolidate the knowledge about the structure and work of the machine code. I was planning to implement the binary file compilation, but for now BFC can compile only in memory. It is unlikely that I will be able to finish this project.
